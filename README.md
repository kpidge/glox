# glox

A work-in-progress implementation of Lox, following Robert Nystrom's book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). The book walks through implementing a tree-walk interpreter in Java; I have chosen to implement it in Go, as a means to learn the language. This is the first program I have written in Go, so I anticipate looking back at the end of this project and wondering 'why did I do it like this?'.
